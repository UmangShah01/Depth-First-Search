# What is Depth-First-Search
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm starts at the **root (top) node** of a tree and goes as far as it can down a given branch (path), 
then backtracks until it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it.
The algorithm does this until the entire graph has been explored.
DFS Algorithm is used in many problems like matching in a graph, taveling salesman problems.
DFS Algorithm is almost same as BFS Algorithm ie, it means it works same ,but the only difference their is bfs travels level vise 
and dfs travels from root to the leaf node and than backtracks to next node in that level.

# Steps To Implement 
  1. Start From The Root Node.
  2. Traverse till the leaf Node of it.
  3. BackTrack to the immdiate parent node.
  4. Repeat Untill all the nodes have traversed or reach the goal node.
  
 # Note:
 **_The Depth-First-Search TARVERSAL SHOULD NOT REPEAT A NODE , IT WILL GO INTO LOOP WHILE EXECUTING IT ON PROGRAM_**
  
  # For Eg: 
  The Depth-First-Search Traversal is:**1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10**
